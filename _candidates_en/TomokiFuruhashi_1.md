Google Cloud Dataflow is a fully managed service that enables both streaming and batch data processing. By using Google Cloud Dataflow, we engineers can focus on the code, instead of getting distracted with infrastructure matters like cluster management. Through integration with tools such as Cloud Pub/Sub and BigQuery, we can build a data analysis foundation on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

In this session, I will start with the basics of data processing, then, through the demonstration of Google Cloud Dataflow, I will show how to get started on Google Cloud Dataflow in Scala and describe the benefits of using the GCP for data processing.
