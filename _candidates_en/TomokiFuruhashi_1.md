Google Cloud Dataflow is a fully managed service that enable both streaming and batch data processing. By using Google Cloud Dataflow, we engineers can focus on the code, instead of getting distracted with infrastructure matters like cluster management. Through the integration with tools like Cloud Pub/Sub and BigQuery, we can build a data analysis foundation on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

In this session, I will start with the basics of data processing, and through the demonstration of Google Cloud Dataflow, we will look into how to get started on Google Cloud Dataflow in Scala and the benefits of using GCP for data processing.
