According to changes of collection libraries in Scala 2.13, some functions will be removed.
One of the most effective changes in that is removing of `CanBuildFrom` class and `breakOUt` method.

In this talk, I will show you some examples of substitute codes, and explain what the benefits of new implementation in 2.13 are.
