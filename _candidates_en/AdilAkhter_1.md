In recent years, distributed stream processing systems (DSPS) have become the de-facto standard for processing fast data. In this comparative study, we look at the fundamental of stream processing. We give an overview of how the streaming landscape has evolved, and analyze the state-of-the-art DSPSs from two main perspectives: programming models and execution semantics. While basing a foundation on their commonalities, we build a core abstraction to reason about their semantics. Based on that we differentiate the different approaches of DSPS in addressing the core issues of stream processing.
