Everyone says "Scala and Kotlin are similar," but is it actually true? The are indeed syntactical similarities but there are many fundamental differences. From the experience of using both Scala and Kotlin extensively at work, I would like to discuss how different languages Scala and Kotlin are through code examples.

This would also be an opportunity to learn some the strange commonalities between the two distinct languages that are syntacitally similar. We will also cover the functional programming libraries (Scala, Cats, Arrow) from both.
