Depending on a team or a person, there are different ways to place constructor arguments, to write Scaladoc, or to pronounce "Either." These diversity allows for personal taste, but it might be a bit confusing to new learners.

In this session, we will look into different cultures in Scala through the official Style Guide, and the code from open source projects. The goal is to learn together that "some people write like this" not to convince "what's right." It might also be fun to take a poll beforehand, and discuss the result on the day.
