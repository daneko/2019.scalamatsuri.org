When you are developing in a team, have you ever found the requirements to be vague, or felt something is not right about the domain model? We often hear about the projects where the modeling and design are done based on some individuals' sense or skills. It's not hard to imagine where the road would lead -- spiral of harmful effect such as increasing cost to add new features and technical debts.

In this session, we would like to introduce a formal approach to requirements capturing, domain modeling, and detail designs without relying on intuition. We've written the output from each phase using Scala, and would like to discuss the overall benefit of using Scala in this approach. Our overarching goal is to capture the business requirements and continuously provide quality software in a consistent manner as the team.
