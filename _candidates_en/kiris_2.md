As Scala is being adopted by various companies and products, with many engineers using Scala at work, I think Scala as a language has entered into a new chapter.

In this session specificcally for professional Scala engineers, I would like to share the lessons I've learned, and still cherish, through using Scala for the last ten years. These lessons are not necessarily specific to Scala. Rather, many of the points are about keeping one's eyes out for the world outside of Scala.

Here are some examples:

- Learn through kata, not types.
- All developers tend to over-elaborate the solution based on our ideals.
- Use any method necessary to solve the problem.

These "living lessons", which I hope to share, are things I often learned the hard way while using Scala in the real world.
