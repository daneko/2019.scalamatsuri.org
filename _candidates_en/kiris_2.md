As Scala is being adopted by various companies and products, with many engineers using Scala at work, I think Scala as a language has entered into a new chapter.

In this session for the professional Scala engineers, I would like to share the lessons I learned, and still cherish through using Scala for ten years. These are not necessarily specific to Scala. Rather, many of the points are about keeping the eyes out to the world outside of Scala.

Here are some examples:

- Learn through kata, not types.
- All developers tend to over-elaborate the solution based our ideals.
- Use any methods to solve the problems.

These "living lessons", which I hope to share, are something I often learned the hard way by using Scala in the real world.
