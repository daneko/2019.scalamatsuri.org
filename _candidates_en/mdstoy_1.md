Speakers are essential to a conference. However, they shouldn't be limited to the famed, the greats, and the cool kids. When considering the progress of the community, it's crucial to have fresh speakers.

I would like discuss my own experience of submitting a CfP to a conference, getting selected, and having given a talk as a 40-something nobody engineer -- what do you need to become a speaker, why you should try to give a talk, and what happens when you give a talk (and what doesn't happen)?
